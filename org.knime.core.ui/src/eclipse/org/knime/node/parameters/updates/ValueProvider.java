 *  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the
 *  license terms of ECLIPSE themselves allow for the respective use and
 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through
 *  standard APIs ("Nodes"):
 *  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be

 *  License, the License does not apply to Nodes, you are not required to
 *  license Nodes under the License, and you are granted a license to
 *  prepare and propagate Nodes, in each case even if such Nodes are
 *  propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.  The owner of a Node
 *  may freely choose the license terms applicable to such Node, including
 *  when such Node is propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.

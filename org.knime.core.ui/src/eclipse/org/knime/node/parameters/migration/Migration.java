/**
 * Defines how a field or class is migrated from a pervious version of settings.
 *
 * <p>
 * A migration - in contrast to a {@link Persistor} - is needed when the structure of the settings has changed, i.e.
 * there can exist versions of the node saved with settings that characterize the state of the node to before a certain
 * point in time when the saved settings structure was changed. Defining a migration is necessary for two reasons:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To be able to still load from these old settings.</li>
 * <li>To not break flow variables set for old configs that are not saved to again.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that the first point could be achieved by using a {@link Persistor} but the second one cannot.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * In simple cases, using {@link Migrate @Migrate} instead is sufficient.

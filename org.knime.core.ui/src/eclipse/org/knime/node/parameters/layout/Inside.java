 *  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the

 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through

 *  license Nodes under the License, and you are granted a license to
 *  prepare and propagate Nodes, in each case even if such Nodes are
 *  propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.  The owner of a Node
 *  may freely choose the license terms applicable to such Node, including

/**
 * An annotation for a layout part to ensure that the annotated element appears <b>nested inside</b> the referenced
 * layout part.
 *
 * Note that this annotation is not meant to be used on a {@link WidgetGroup} to define where the contained widgets and
 * layouts should be placed. This is possible using a {@link Layout} annotation on the widget group field.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // "Horizontal layout" will be displayed inside "Section 2"
 *
 * interface MyLayout {
 *
 *     &#64;Section(title = "Horizontal layout")
 *     &#64;Inside(AnotherLayout.Section2.class)

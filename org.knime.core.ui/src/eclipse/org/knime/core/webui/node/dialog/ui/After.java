 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,

/**
 * An annotation for a layout part to ensure that the annotated element appears <b>after</b> the referenced layout part.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * interface MyLayout {
 *
 *     &#64;Section(title = "Section 1")
 *     &#64;After(Section2.class) // "Section 1" will be displayed after "Section 2"
 *     interface Section1 {
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Section(title = "Section 2")
 *     interface Section2 {
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This can also be used to target classes which do not have the same enclosing class and with that enables to combine
 * two layouts. Note that in this case the enclosing class of the annotated interface will not be excluded from the
 * layout.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * interface MyLayout {
 *
 *     &#64;Section(title = "My Section")
 *     &#64;After(CommonLayout.CommonSection.class) // "My Section" will be displayed after "Common Section"
 *     interface MySection {
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * interface CommonLayout {
 *     &#64;Section(title = "Common Section")
 *     interface CommonSection {
 *     }

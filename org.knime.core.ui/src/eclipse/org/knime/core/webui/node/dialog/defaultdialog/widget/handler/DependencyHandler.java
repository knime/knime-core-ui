 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,

/**
 *
 * The fields specified in this class have to reference other settings of the current node settings. To reference a
 * setting, use the same name and the same type (for nested settings all names along the way have to match) as the field
 * that is to be referenced. If there is a field which is not unique with respect to its field name and type, use the
 * {@link DeclaringDefaultNodeSettings} annotation to further specify the specific node settings class of the field.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *            class OtherSettings {
 *                  // referencing "MyNodeModelSettings#m_foo".
 *                  &#64;DeclaringDefaultNodeSettings(MyNodeModelSettings.class)
 *                  String m_bar;
 *            }
 *
 *            class MyActionHandler implements DialogDataServiceHandler<String, OtherSettings>
 *
 *            class MyNodeViewSettings extends NodeParameters {
 *
 *                &#64;Widget
 *                &#64;ButtonWidget(actionHandler = MyActionHandler)
 *                String m_foo;
 *
 *                &#64;Widget
 *                String m_bar;
 *
 *            }
 *
 *            class MyNodeModelSettings extends NodeParameters {
 *                &#64;Widget
 *                String m_bar;
 *            }
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * For simple scenarios where there is only one {@link NodeParameters} class used and a setting should depend on
 * all other settings, the {@link NodeParameters} class itself can be directly used as the generic class.
 *
 * @param <S> the settings, the handler is depending on.

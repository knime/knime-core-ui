 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through

 *  license Nodes under the License, and you are granted a license to
 *  prepare and propagate Nodes, in each case even if such Nodes are
 *  propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.  The owner of a Node
 *  may freely choose the license terms applicable to such Node, including

/**
 * This package contains widget annotations that are **internal** and not intended for public use. These annotations
 * exist either for KNIME-internal purposes or are not polished enough for public exposure. As such, the APIs provided
 * in this package may change without notice and do **not** follow the stability guarantees of the public API. They may
 * be modified or removed in future releases.
 *
 * <h3>Internal Counterparts</h3>
 *
 * Some public widgets have internal counterparts that provide additional configuration options.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Naming Convention:</strong> Internal widgets should follow the naming pattern: <code>*Internal</code>.

 * The following table maps public widgets to their internal counterparts, which offer additional configuration options:

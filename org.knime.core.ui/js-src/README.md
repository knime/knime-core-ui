# ![Image](https://www.knime.com/files/knime_logo_github_40x40_4layers.png) KNIME views & dialogs

This repository contains the frontend components of the KNIME views and dialogs which are based on [Vue].
They are built as [Vue libraries] and used in KNIME Analytics Platform and/or KNIME WebPortal.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Install [Node.js][node], see version in [package.json](package.json).

Newer versions may also work, but have not been tested.

Pull the contained [git submodules](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4438292/5134084) with
```sh
git submodule update --init
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

and then use the following commands. For detailed explanations see [Vue CLI docs]:

### View development in KNIME Analytics Platform

First, depending on which view you want to develop, start the according dev command (see [package.json](package.json)) which
starts a web server and re-builds the library on source file change. E.g. for the TableView it would be:

```sh
npm run dev:TableView
```

Second, please add following to the run configuration in Eclipse and start KNIME Analytics Platform:
```
-Dorg.knime.ui.dev.node.view.url=http://localhost:4000/<ComponentName>.umd.min.js
-Dchromium.remote_debugging_port=8888
```

`<ComponentName>` needs to be filled with the component you want to develop, e.g.:
`-Dorg.knime.ui.dev.node.view.url=http://localhost:4000/TableView.umd.min.js`

When opening a view in KNIME Analytics Platform the above JS file will be loaded instead of the bundled one.
Hot-code reloading is not supported yet, so you need to refresh the browser window manually for now.

Currently no standalone development mode is supported.

### Dialog development in KNIME Analytics Platform

Node dialogs can be integrated during development quite similar to views (see above), e.g. run

```sh
npm run dev:NodeDialog
```

and set the following in the run configuration of Eclipse:
```
-Dorg.knime.ui.dev.node.dialog.url=http://localhost:3333/NodeDialog.umd.min.js
```

For dialogs there also is a standalone dev app with mocks available:
```sh
npm run dev:NodeDialog:standalone
```





### Testing

#### Running unit tests
This project contains unit tests written with [jest]. They are run with

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

During development, you can use `npm run test:unit -- --watch` to have the unit tests run automatically whenever a
source file changes.

You can generate a coverage report with

```sh
npm run coverage
```

The output can be found in the `coverage` folder. It contains a browseable html report as well as raw coverage data in
[LCOV] and [Clover] format, which can be used in analysis software (SonarQube, Jenkins, â€¦).


### Running security audit

npm provides a check against known security issues of used dependencies. Run it by calling
```sh
npm run audit
```

### Logging

You can log using the global `consola` variable (which the embedding application needs to provide).

See https://github.com/nuxt/consola for details.

## Building

To build all views and dialogs, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

To build a single item, use e.g. the following command:

```sh
npm run build:TableView
```

Results are saved to `/dist`.

This project can also be built via a maven build wrapper

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Embedding the views in apps

The views can be used in Vue/Nuxt apps like a regular Vue component, e.g. loaded asynchronously.
 
### Requirements

The views expect that the embedding app provides the following:

- Vue and Consola compatible to the versions defined in [`package.json`](package.json)
- global `window.consola` instance for logging
- CSS variables as defined in the `webapps-common` project.
  They are not included in the build in order to avoid duplication.

### Usage example

```
<TableView>
```

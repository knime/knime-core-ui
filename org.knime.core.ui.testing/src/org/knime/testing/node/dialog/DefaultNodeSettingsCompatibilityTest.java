 * For testing that legacy settings can still be read and provide the expected defaults.

 * <p>
 * The old regex split node produced an output table that had columns <code>split_0, split_1, ... </code>. After
 * migrating the dialog, the user can change the output structure. But when loading old settings that do not have the
